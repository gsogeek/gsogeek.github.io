		<h1>Hello world, what's up?</h1>
		<p>A profile and some other stuff will be coming here soon, keep an eye out here.</p>
		<p>Be aware this page will change and probably also go away for a while as I learn how to work with the GIT command line. <br />
		Gotta learn somewhere, right?</p>

		<p>I'm also using this as a learning place for getting a grip on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (mostly React right now, but there could be more to come).</p>
